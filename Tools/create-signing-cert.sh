# The certificate is valid for 100 years on purpose. macOS pins an app's calendar,
# reminders, automation and keychain grants to the signing certificate, so what
# forces every user to re-authorise is *replacing* the certificate, not it
# expiring. Keep this one.
#
# Whoever holds the .p12 can sign software macOS will treat as this app, so move
# it into 1Password and delete the local copy; the printed steps say how.
